# VictoriaSecret-Ecommerce-Product-Analysis

This project is what I did for a VictoriaSecret E-commerce Product Analysis using Python Pandas.

- dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/innerwear-data-from-victorias-secret-and-others
  --> victoriassecret_com.csv
The dataset contains information about various products such as their name, price, colour, available size, rating, and review count, among others.

- The project involves 
   · Loading data and previewing dataset, including checking null values and so forth
   · Preprocess data, including changing columns into the same currencies, filling null values and so forth
   · Data lookup, such as finding the cheapest product, the most common colour of best-rated products, and checking the discount between price and MRP. The questions are answered by performing various data manipulation and analysis techniques such as filtering, grouping, sorting, and aggregating the data using Pandas.

Overall, this project demonstrates how Python Pandas can be used to gain insights from a real-world e-commerce product dataset.
